# Scene-Dash

A Bevy-inspired, **Dart-native** ECS and plugin layer for
[`flutter_scene`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_scene). Scene-Dash gives you
class-based plugins and systems, generated parameter injection, and cached
sparse-set queries over **ordinary mutable Dart objects** while keeping the
game-authoring surface tiny:

```dart
final game = Game(scene: scene)
  ..addPlugin(const InputPlugin())
  ..addPlugin(const PlayerPlugin());

await game.start();

return SceneView(scene, cameraBuilder: buildCamera, onTick: game.onTick);
```

Scene-Dash **complements** `flutter_scene`; it does not replace its scene graph,
renderer, cameras, nodes, physics world, or frame loop. The integration lets ECS
systems work directly with those native objects.

## Smallest Complete Example

Scene-Dash code is organized from the app downward:

- create a `flutter_scene` `Scene`;
- wrap it in a `Game`;
- add plugins;
- plugins register systems;
- systems query ordinary Dart objects and mutate the scene.

```dart
import 'dart:math';

import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:flutter_scene/scene.dart';
import 'package:scene_dash/scene_dash.dart';
import 'package:scene_dash_flutter_scene/scene_dash_flutter_scene.dart';
import 'package:vector_math/vector_math.dart' show Vector3;

part 'main.g.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  await Scene.initializeStaticResources();

  final scene = Scene();
  final game = Game(scene: scene)..addPlugin(const CubeOrbitPlugin());
  await game.start();

  runApp(
    MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        body: SceneView(
          scene,
          cameraBuilder: _camera,
          onTick: game.onTick,
        ),
      ),
    ),
  );
}

Camera _camera(Duration elapsed) {
  return PerspectiveCamera(
    position: Vector3(0, 3, -6),
    target: Vector3.zero(),
  );
}

@GamePlugin()
final class CubeOrbitPlugin extends Plugin {
  const CubeOrbitPlugin();

  @override
  void build(AppBuilder app) {
    app
      ..addSystem(
        const SpawnCubeSystem(),
        schedule: Schedules.startup,
        label: const SystemLabel('demo.spawn'),
      )
      ..addSystem(
        const OrbitSystem(),
        schedule: Schedules.update,
        label: const SystemLabel('demo.orbit'),
      );
  }
}

@System()
final class SpawnCubeSystem extends GameSystem with _$SpawnCubeSystem {
  const SpawnCubeSystem();

  void run(Commands commands) {
    commands.spawn(CubeBundle());
  }
}

@System()
final class OrbitSystem extends GameSystem with _$OrbitSystem {
  const OrbitSystem();

  void run(
    @Query(writes: [SceneTransform, Orbit])
    Query2<SceneTransform, Orbit> movers,
    @Resource() FrameTime time,
  ) {
    movers.each((entity, transform, orbit) {
      orbit.phase += orbit.speed * time.delta;
      transform
        ..x = orbit.radius * cos(orbit.phase)
        ..z = orbit.radius * sin(orbit.phase);
    });
  }
}

@ObjectComponent()
final class Orbit {
  final double radius;
  final double speed;
  double phase;

  Orbit({required this.radius, required this.speed, this.phase = 0});
}

@Bundle()
final class CubeBundle with _$CubeBundle {
  static final Mesh mesh =
      Mesh(CuboidGeometry(Vector3.all(0.8)), UnlitMaterial());

  final SceneTransform transform = SceneTransform.zero();
  final Orbit orbit = Orbit(radius: 2, speed: 1);
  final SceneNodeRef node = SceneNodeRef(Node(mesh: mesh));
}
```

Run `build_runner` to generate the system and bundle adapters:

```bash
dart run build_runner build
```

That is the whole loop: `Game` drives schedules from `SceneView`, startup spawns
an entity with a `SceneTransform` and `SceneNodeRef`, and the integration mounts
the node and syncs the transform to `flutter_scene`.

The same ECS core also works without Flutter for headless tests and simulations:

```dart
final app = App()..addPlugin(const CubeOrbitPlugin());

app.start();
app.runSchedule(Schedules.update);
```

## Quick Start

This repository is a Dart pub workspace. Because the scene integration depends on
Flutter and `flutter_scene`, resolve it from the root with Flutter:

```bash
flutter pub get
dart analyze packages/scene_dash
flutter analyze packages/scene_dash_flutter_scene
```

Generated systems and bundles use `build_runner`:

```bash
cd examples/minimal_game
dart run build_runner build
dart test
```

For a Flutter scene example:

```bash
cd examples/scene_game
flutter run --enable-flutter-gpu
```

## Feature Tour

The rest of the README breaks that small example apart into the features you can
combine in larger games. A typical generated file starts like this:

```dart
import 'package:scene_dash/scene_dash.dart';

part 'game.g.dart';
```

### Object Components

`@ObjectComponent()` is the normal component type. Each entity stores a
reference to an ordinary Dart object.

```dart
@ObjectComponent()
final class Velocity {
  double x;
  double y;
  double z;

  Velocity(this.x, this.y, this.z);
}
```

Systems receive the actual object and mutate it in place. There are no
snapshots, proxy objects, or component reconstruction steps.

```dart
@System()
final class AccelerateSystem extends GameSystem with _$AccelerateSystem {
  const AccelerateSystem();

  void run(
    @Query(writes: [Velocity])
    Query1<Velocity> velocities,
  ) {
    velocities.each((entity, velocity) {
      velocity.x += 1;
    });
  }
}
```

Use object components for almost everything: health, AI state, inventories,
controllers, transforms, velocities, `flutter_scene` node references, and
game-specific state.

### Tags and Query Filters

`@Tag()` is a marker component with no per-entity object payload. Tags are useful
for filters such as player/enemy/team/state markers.

```dart
@Tag()
final class Player {
  const Player();
}

@System()
final class MovePlayersSystem extends GameSystem with _$MovePlayersSystem {
  const MovePlayersSystem();

  void run(
    @Query(writes: [Position], requires: [Player])
    Query2<Position, Velocity> players,
    @Resource() FixedTime time,
  ) {
    players.each((entity, position, velocity) {
      position
        ..x += velocity.x * time.delta
        ..y += velocity.y * time.delta;
    });
  }
}
```

Queries support positive and negative filters:

```dart
@Query(requires: [Player], excludes: [Stunned])
Query2<Position, Velocity> movers
```

### Bundles

`@Bundle()` is a typed spawn recipe. The generator emits the insertion code, so
one `commands.spawn(bundle)` inserts every field as a component.

```dart
@Bundle()
final class PlayerBundle with _$PlayerBundle {
  final Position position;
  final Velocity velocity;
  final Player player;
  final Health health;

  PlayerBundle({
    required this.position,
    required this.velocity,
  })  : player = const Player(),
        health = Health(100);
}

@System()
final class SpawnPlayerSystem extends GameSystem with _$SpawnPlayerSystem {
  const SpawnPlayerSystem();

  void run(Commands commands) {
    commands.spawn(
      PlayerBundle(
        position: Position(0, 0),
        velocity: Velocity(1, 0, 0),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

### Commands

Structural changes are deferred until a safe schedule boundary, so sparse-set
swap removal never invalidates a running query.

```dart
void run(Commands commands) {
  final entity = commands.spawn();

  commands
      .entity(entity)
      .insert(Position(0, 0))
      .insert(Velocity(1, 0, 0));

  commands.remove<Stunned>(entity);
  commands.despawn(entity);
}
```

In debug and test builds, commands targeting stale entities trip assertions when
the command buffer is applied.

### Resources

Resources are singleton objects stored in the world. Generated systems resolve
them once during initialization and receive the same instance every run.

```dart
final class InputState {
  double horizontal = 0;
  bool jumpPressed = false;
}

@System()
final class ReadInputSystem extends GameSystem with _$ReadInputSystem {
  const ReadInputSystem();

  void run(@Resource() InputState input) {
    if (input.jumpPressed) {
      // update gameplay state
    }
  }
}
```

Plugins insert resources:

```dart
app.insertResource<InputState>(InputState());
```

Game code that needs direct world access can use safe helpers:

```dart
if (world.has<Health>(entity)) {
  final health = world.get<Health>(entity);
  health.value -= 10;
}

final input = world.tryResource<InputState>();
```

### Events

Events are typed channels with independent reader cursors. One system can send
an event and several systems can read it without stealing it from each other.

```dart
final class PlayerSpawned {
  final Entity entity;
  const PlayerSpawned(this.entity);
}

@System()
final class SpawnSystem extends GameSystem with _$SpawnSystem {
  const SpawnSystem();

  void run(Commands commands, EventWriter<PlayerSpawned> spawned) {
    final entity = commands.spawn(PlayerBundle(
      position: Position(0, 0),
      velocity: Velocity(0, 0, 0),
    ));
    spawned.send(PlayerSpawned(entity));
  }
}

@System()
final class SpawnLogSystem extends GameSystem with _$SpawnLogSystem {
  const SpawnLogSystem();

  void run(EventReader<PlayerSpawned> spawned) {
    spawned.forEach((event) {
      // handle event without allocating a result list
    });
  }
}
```

Register event ownership explicitly in a plugin:

```dart
app.addEvent<PlayerSpawned>();
```

Generated event adapters also register channels idempotently as an ergonomic
safety net.

### Plugins and Schedules

Plugins collect systems, resources, events, dependencies, and setup. They are
ordinary classes; the annotation gives the generator metadata to validate.

```dart
@GamePlugin()
final class InputPlugin extends Plugin {
  const InputPlugin();

  @override
  void build(AppBuilder app) {
    app.insertResource<InputState>(InputState());
  }
}

@GamePlugin(requires: [InputPlugin])
final class PlayerPlugin extends Plugin with _$PlayerPlugin {
  const PlayerPlugin();

  @override
  void build(AppBuilder app) {
    app
      ..addEvent<PlayerSpawned>()
      ..addSystem(
        const SpawnSystem(),
        schedule: Schedules.startup,
        label: const SystemLabel('player.spawn'),
      )
      ..addSystem(
        const MovePlayersSystem(),
        schedule: Schedules.update,
        label: const SystemLabel('player.move'),
      );
  }
}
```

Built-in schedules include frame start, fixed pre-physics, update, render sync,
startup, and shutdown. Access-conflict diagnostics can warn or error when
unordered systems both write the same component, or one writes what another
reads.

## `flutter_scene` Integration

`scene_dash_flutter_scene` wraps the pure-Dart `App` in a scene-aware `Game`.
On start, it:

- exposes the real `Scene` and `SceneCommands` as resources;
- mounts entity-bound `SceneNodeRef` nodes into the scene;
- syncs optional `SceneTransform` components onto bound nodes;
- attaches one internal scene driver and exposes `game.onTick` for `SceneView`.

### Direct Node Path: Mutate Nodes Yourself

The starter example uses `SceneTransform` because it is the easiest path to
understand. When you want to avoid duplicated transform state, store a
`SceneNodeRef` and mutate the native `flutter_scene` node directly.

```dart
@ObjectComponent()
final class Orbit {
  final double radius;
  final double speed;
  double phase;

  Orbit({required this.radius, required this.speed, required this.phase});
}

@Bundle()
final class CubeBundle with _$CubeBundle {
  static final Mesh mesh =
      Mesh(CuboidGeometry(Vector3.all(0.8)), UnlitMaterial());

  final Orbit orbit;
  final SceneNodeRef node;

  CubeBundle({required double phase})
      : orbit = Orbit(radius: 3, speed: 1, phase: phase),
        node = SceneNodeRef(Node(mesh: mesh));
}

@System()
final class OrbitNodesSystem extends GameSystem with _$OrbitNodesSystem {
  const OrbitNodesSystem();

  void run(
    @Query(writes: [Orbit])
    Query2<Orbit, SceneNodeRef> movers,
    @Resource() FrameTime time,
  ) {
    movers.each((entity, orbit, nodeRef) {
      orbit.phase += orbit.speed * time.delta;
      nodeRef.node.localTransform.setTranslationRaw(
        orbit.radius * cos(orbit.phase),
        0,
        orbit.radius * sin(orbit.phase),
      );
      nodeRef.node.markTransformDirty();
    });
  }
}
```

The ECS stores the node reference directly. This is less data-oriented than
Bevy, but much more natural in Flutter and Dart.

### ECS-Owned Transforms

Use `SceneTransform` when the ECS should own transform state: networking,
serialization, headless simulation, rollback, save files, or renderer
independence.

```dart
final transform = SceneTransform.zero()
  ..setTranslation(0, 1, 0)
  ..setRotationY(angle)
  ..setUniformScale(1.5);
```

`SceneTransform` is a local translation/rotation/scale component with a complete
gameplay API: translation (`setTranslation`, `translate`), scale (`setScale`,
`setUniformScale`), rotation (`setRotationX/Y/Z`, `setRotationEuler`,
`setRotationAxisAngle`, `setRotation`, and relative `rotate`/`rotateX/Y/Z`),
`lookAt`, copy/reset (`setFrom`, `setIdentity`), and a matrix escape hatch
(`setFromMatrix`, `toMatrix`). Angles are radians; forward is −Z and up is +Y.
The fields stay directly mutable, so there is no dirty tracking — helper calls
and direct field mutation are equivalent.

The integration writes it onto the bound node during `Schedules.renderSync`. Add
`PhysicsDriven` to entities whose node transform is owned by physics or another
authority, so generic sync skips them.

Games with a different transform type can use `CustomSceneSyncPlugin<T>` and
provide either a translation callback or a full matrix writer.

### Scene Commands

Use `SceneCommands` for deferred scene-graph mutations from systems.

```dart
@System()
final class AddDecorationSystem extends GameSystem with _$AddDecorationSystem {
  const AddDecorationSystem();

  void run(@Resource() SceneCommands sceneCommands) {
    sceneCommands.add(Node());
  }
}
```

## Physics and Collisions

`PhysicsPlugin` is an optional convenience adapter for one default native
`flutter_scene` `PhysicsWorld` per `Game`.

```dart
final physicsWorld = BasicPhysicsWorld();
scene.root.addComponent(physicsWorld);

final game = Game(scene: scene)
  ..addPlugin(PhysicsPlugin(physicsWorld))
  ..addPlugin(const GameplayPlugin());
```

The plugin inserts the `PhysicsWorld` as a resource and republishes raw
`CollisionEvent`s into ECS events.

```dart
@System()
final class ReadCollisionsSystem extends GameSystem
    with _$ReadCollisionsSystem {
  const ReadCollisionsSystem();

  void run(EventReader<CollisionEvent> collisions) {
    collisions.forEach((collision) {
      // Convert raw backend collision data into game events.
    });
  }
}
```

For larger games, treat raw collision events as a bridge boundary. Store masks,
layers, teams, sensors, or hitbox metadata in ordinary components/resources, then
emit game-specific events:

```dart
final class HitEvent {
  final Entity attacker;
  final Entity target;
  final int damage;

  const HitEvent({
    required this.attacker,
    required this.target,
    required this.damage,
  });
}

@ObjectComponent()
final class CollisionMask {
  final int layer;
  final int collidesWith;

  const CollisionMask({required this.layer, required this.collidesWith});
}
```

That gives you Rapier-style gameplay semantics without pretending this package
owns a specific physics backend.

## How It Works

### Use Objects Instead of Fighting Dart

Trying to emulate Rust structs with generated typed-array cursors everywhere
adds complexity without a measured advantage for this use case.

The default component model remains:

```dart
@ObjectComponent()
final class Velocity {
  double x;
  double y;
  double z;

  Velocity(this.x, this.y, this.z);
}
```

Object stores are roughly:

```text
entity IDs: [4, 9, 12]
values:     [Velocity(...), Velocity(...), Velocity(...)]
```

Queries pass direct existing references to systems, and systems mutate those
objects in place.

### Code Generation Without Runtime Reflection

`source_gen` provides typed injection, validated bundles, plugin metadata,
access metadata, event/channel setup, and specialized adapters while the runtime
stays explicit and reflection-free.

That gives much of Bevy's authoring ergonomics without pretending Dart has
Rust's monomorphization or memory model.

### Cache Everything Stable

Generated adapters resolve stable handles once during initialization:

- component stores;
- resources;
- event channels;
- query filters;
- iteration drivers.

A frame should not repeatedly perform service lookup, reflection, or query
construction.

### Allocate Nothing Per Matching Entity

Hot queries avoid result lists, records per entity, component copies, iterator
wrappers, temporary vectors, temporary matrices, and closures created inside the
inner loop.

The target loop is still simple:

```dart
query.each((entity, transform, velocity) {
  transform.x += velocity.x * delta;
});
```

### Drive From the Smallest Store

For a query like:

```dart
@Query(requires: [Player])
Query2<Transform, Velocity> players
```

Scene-Dash iterates whichever positive store has the fewest members, then checks
the rest through sparse arrays. This helps selective gameplay queries, even
though it is not trying to beat Bevy's table iteration for broad homogeneous
workloads.

### Avoid Duplicated Scene Data By Default

Duplicating every node transform into ECS state and syncing it every frame is
not always the best default. For visual-only state, use `SceneNodeRef` and mutate
the native node. Reach for `SceneTransform` when ECS-owned state actually buys
you serialization, rollback, networking, renderer independence, or headless
simulation.

## Verification

Useful checks while developing:

```bash
flutter pub get
dart analyze packages/scene_dash
flutter analyze packages/scene_dash_flutter_scene
```

Package-specific tests:

```bash
cd packages/scene_dash
dart test

cd ../scene_dash_flutter_scene
flutter test
```

The `flutter_scene` integration imports `package:flutter_scene/scene.dart` for the
0.18.x API.
