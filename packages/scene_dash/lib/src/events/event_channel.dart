/// therefore kept for at most [retainedUpdates] maintenance passes: readers
/// that lag further behind skip the dropped events instead of leaking memory.
/// With the default of `2` and one [update] per frame, an event sent during
/// frame `N` stays readable through frames `N` and `N + 1` — the same window
/// Bevy's double-buffered events provide. Systems that read their channels
/// every frame never miss anything. Pass `null` to retain events until every
/// reader has consumed them, however long that takes.
