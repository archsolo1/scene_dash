///
/// Each run it reconciles the set of bound nodes against the scene:
///
/// * a newly bound node with no parent is queued under the scene root (through
///   [SceneCommands]) and remembered;
/// * a node the integration previously mounted whose binding has gone — the
///   entity was despawned, the [SceneNodeRef] was removed, or it was replaced
///   with a different node — is queued for detachment.
///
/// A node the game parents itself (custom hierarchy) is never adopted and never
/// auto-detached: only nodes this adapter mounted are tracked. This makes the
/// common case — `commands.spawn(bundle)` then later `commands.despawn(entity)`
/// — clean up its scene node automatically, with no manual `SceneCommands.remove`
/// in game code.
///
/// It also maintains the integration-managed [Mounted] tag: each mounted entity
/// gains [Mounted] and loses it on unmount, so advanced systems can filter on
/// scene-mounted entities.
///
/// [Game] runs this *before* the `update` phase each frame (and once at startup),
/// so a bound node is already parented and tagged by the time gameplay reads it.
