/// A state machine is registered with `AppBuilder.addState<S>(initial)`, where
/// [S] is normally an enum. Registration inserts two resources:
///
/// * [CurrentState] of `S` — the active value, read-only from systems;
/// * [NextState] of `S` — where systems queue a transition.
///
/// Transitions are applied at [App.applyStateTransitions] (called at the
/// frame-start boundary by the standard driver): the machine runs the
/// [OnExit] schedule for the old value, swaps [CurrentState], then runs the
/// [OnEnter] schedule for the new value. Steady-state gating uses the
/// [inState] run condition:
///
/// ```dart
/// enum GamePhase { title, overworld, dungeon }
///
/// app
///   ..addState<GamePhase>(GamePhase.title)
///   ..addSystem(spawnDungeonSystem, schedule: OnEnter(GamePhase.dungeon))
///   ..addSystem(saveDungeonProgressSystem, schedule: OnExit(GamePhase.dungeon))
///   ..addSystem(movePlayerSystem,
///       schedule: Schedules.update, runIf: inState(GamePhase.overworld));
/// ```
///
/// Enter/exit schedules are for world-side work (spawning a region, saving
/// progress); screens and menus stay Flutter widgets that observe the current
/// state and switch layers.
///
/// Multiple machines of different types coexist (e.g. a `GamePhase` and an
/// orthogonal `PauseState`); each gets its own resource pair and transitions
/// independently.
